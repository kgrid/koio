Note:
Different examples in this folder use different versions of KOIO. Look at the context link or koio:KOIOVersion in the metadata file for each example to find out which version of KOIO is used to creat each of these examples. 

The examples that are created using the current version of the KOIO are used to create individuals in the OWL file and also to create tests.
