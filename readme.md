# KOIO
This repository is for evolving, sharing, and managing the Knowledge Object Implementation Ontology (KOIO). KOIO formally defines the structure of Knowledge Objects using linked data representations made available in OWL files. 

A Knowledge Object is an information content resource and, when concretized, also a compound digital object that is formalized as a lightweight or minimalist user-oriented, computation-focused container specifically for packaging and organizing machine-processable knowledge assets with code that runs.

## Knowledge Systems Laboratory

The Knowledge Systems Laboratory (KSL) created KOIO. KSL is an R&D lab in the Department of Learning Health Sciences at the University of Michigan Medical School.

## Structure 
Each version of the will be contain in its own version directory.  We will use index.html to redirect to the 
current version and the default KOIO format (OWL).  Each version will contain its own documentation. 

* **index.html** will redirect to the current version
* **version (#.#)** is intended to capture each version or implentation of Knowledge Object Implementation Ontology (KOIO)
  * **index.html** will redirect to the correct KOIO format (_turtle, RDF, JSON LD, etc_)
  * **docs** contains the documentation for this implemetaion of the KOIO
* **contexts** hosts the context files for KnowledgeObject and Implementations
