# KOIO - The Knowledge Object Implementation Ontology
This repository is for evolving, sharing, and managing KOIO. KOIO formally defines the structure of Knowledge Objects using linked data representations made available in canonical OWL files. 

A Knowledge Object is a formally-stuctured information content resource that, when concretized, becomes a compound digital object. By intention, KOIO specifies a lightweight or minimalist user-oriented, computation-focused digital object container specifically for packaging and organizing machine-processable knowledge assets that include "code that runs."



KOIO ontology is currently used in the [Knowledge Grid (KGrid) poject](https://github.com/kgrid/specs/blob/master/docs/evolving-conceptual-model.md) for [creating knowledge objects](https://github.com/kgrid/specs/blob/master/docs/kgrid-knowledge-objects.md).

## Knowledge Systems Laboratory
KSL is an R&D lab in the Department of Learning Health Sciences at the University of Michigan Medical School. KSL created KOIO in 2016-17. It was first conceived as part of the Knowledge Grid (KGrid) project for devising better socio-technical knowledge infrastructure components for learning health systems. By 2023-24, KOIO came to be seen as an important KSL deliverable in its own right.
