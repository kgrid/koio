      <h1 id="koio---the-knowledge-object-implementation-ontology">KOIO - The Knowledge Object Implementation Ontology</h1>
<p>This repository is for evolving, sharing, and managing KOIO. KOIO formally defines the structure of Knowledge Objects using linked data representations made available in canonical OWL files.</p>

<p>A Knowledge Object is a formally-stuctured information content resource that, when concretized, becomes a compound digital object. By intention, KOIO specifies a lightweight or minimalist user-oriented, computation-focused digital object container specifically for packaging and organizing machine-processable knowledge assets that include “code that runs.”</p>

<p>KOIO ontology is currently used in the <a href="https://github.com/kgrid/specs/blob/master/docs/evolving-conceptual-model.md">Knowledge Grid (KGrid) poject</a> for <a href="https://github.com/kgrid/specs/blob/master/docs/kgrid-knowledge-objects.md">creating knowledge objects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-systems-laboratory-ksl">Knowledge Systems Laboratory (KSL)</h2>
<p>KSL is an R&amp;D lab in the Department of Learning Health Sciences at the University of Michigan Medical School. KSL created KOIO in 2016-17. It was first conceived as part of the Knowledge Grid (KGrid) project for devising better socio-technical knowledge infrastructure components for learning health systems. By 2023-24, KOIO came to be seen as an important KSL deliverable in its own right.</p>

<h2 id="development-roles-and-rules">Development roles and rules</h2>
<p>Here are the roles of people who will contribute in the development of this ontology and the rules that they should follow:</p>

<h3 id="roles-workflow">Roles (workflow)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Contributors: Propose a change (create issue in the backlog)</li>
  <li>Committee: Review, approve or disapprove the proposed changes</li>
  <li>Developers: Create a branch for each approved change, complete the change and merge back to the main. If changes to the main are significant, create a new release</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Release Procedures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Latest version of the ontology is always available under the most recent release</li>
      <li>The files in the main branch <strong>are not necessarily</strong> the same as the latest version. Main branch may include new completed updates that are not significant to create a new release yet.</li>
      <li>The repo will not automatically be released on our website with every change to the main.</li>
      <li>A new release with a new version number will be created whenever the main branch is ready with significant changes. Use <strong>Simplified Two-Part Versioning</strong>, which has two parts: Major.Minor</li>
      <li>Different versions of the ontology will be available under releases and tags (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, …)</li>
      <li>Once a new release is created, main (the new version) will manually be deployed on https://kgrid.org/koio/ using GitHub Actions workflow.</li>
      <li>When creating a new release, add a version folder to the main branch like 1.1 and include the context file. The context file will have an @id with the version number (for example: “@id”: “https://kgrid.org/koio/1.0/context” )</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Documentation Procedures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Readme.md includes
        <ul>
          <li>description of the ontology</li>
          <li>download links (link to latest version of the OWL file, Context file and older versions of the ontology)</li>
          <li>documentation link</li>
          <li>description of KSL</li>
          <li>instructions for Proposal and Change (Governance) Procedures</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Technical ontology documentation:
        <ul>
          <li>created using Protégé’s OWLDoc generator for the active ontology</li>
          <li>must be updated every time the ontology changes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Proposal and Change (Governance) Procedures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Change proposals should be recorded under issues in the KOIO Ontology Management project with all the details needed to discuss, plan and execute the change.</li>
      <li>Issue templates will be used to help contributors know all the details needed for their proposed changes (i.e. add term, add synonym, revise subclass relationship, new annotation, Obsolete a term, …) when adding a new issue</li>
      <li>A branch will be created for the work needed to be done to complete each approved change</li>
      <li>Changes are only considered complete and ready for merge to the main when the OWL file, documentation, context files and examples are updated</li>
      <li>Once the changes are finalized they will be merged to the main branch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ontology Evaluation Procedures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Add individuals\instances to the ontology</li>
      <li>Perform Syntax Validation using tools like Protégé</li>
      <li>Develop competency questions</li>
      <li>Implement unit tests using SPARQL Queries</li>
      <li>Integrate testing to GitHub using GitHub Actions for automatic Continuous Integration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
